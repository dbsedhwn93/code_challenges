# Code Challenges

Welcome!

This repo is a quarry of material for interviewing JavaScript developers. Exercises are focused on UI work. Some invite the user to creatively invision a solution to a UX problem. Others provide a solution and ask the interviewee to recreate the mockup in code. And yet others ask the interviewee to do both.

In addition to working code, I ask interviewees to proivde comments for design decisions, architectural dev decision. The comments can be in-code, or a separate summary.
